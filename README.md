# Reponsive-Navbar

Fully Responsive Navbar built from scratch, with HTML, CSS & Js. 
Creating Navbar had always been a stuck and I didn't understand everyting about it, I mean, it was before this project. I've writed the entire code from scratch and I can now even without network create widely responsive navbars from scratch. 

I shared to developers who are still stuck with navbar or even responsive code !

If it helped, follow me on Github, it's free
